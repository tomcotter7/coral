# CORAL (Computer Orchestrated Recognition of Aquatic Life)

C.O.R.A.L (or CORAL) is a project that aims to create a system that can identify fish across cameras set up by the [Cawthron Institute](https://www.cawthron.org.nz/).

In order to do this, we will be finetuning a YoloV11 model on multiple aquatic life detection datasets. We will be releasing the model weights to the scientific community for further research.

The model will be tested on human annotated data, taken directly from the Cawthron Institutes cameras.
